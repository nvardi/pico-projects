# SerialBuffer
The Serial Buffer is a HW/SW component interfacing one or two SportIdent SRR receivers to a RadioCrafts TinyMesh radio.
The SRR-TinyMesh device connects SportIdent SRR stations to a computer running event management software, delivering SportIdent punches to the event management program over distances of some hundred meters.
The serial Buffer solves a problem with the SRR units that do not implement flow control, opening a possibility for losing punches when these arrive close in time to each other.
